Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of machine learning that deals with processing, analyzing, and sometimes generating human speech (“natural language”).
There’s no doubt that humans are still much better than machines at deterimining the meaning of a string of text. But in data science, we’ll often encounter data sets that are far too large to be analyzed by a human in a reasonable amount of time. We may also encounter situations where no human is available to analyze and respond to a piece of text input. In these situations, we can use natural language processing techniques to help machines get some understanding of the text’s meaning (and if necessary, respond accordingly).
For example, natural language processing is widely used in sentiment analysis, since analysts are often trying to determine the overall sentiment from huge volumes of text data that would be time-consuming for humans to comb through. It’s also used in advertisement matching—determining the subject of a body of text and assigning a relevant advertisement automatically. And it’s used in chatbots, voice assistants, and other applications where machines need to understand and quickly respond to input that comes in the form of natural human language.
