And there are think tanks dedicated to studying the physical, cyber and political risks of AI. China is putting its considerable weight behind AI and the European Union is talking about a $22 billion AI investment as it fears losing ground to China and the US. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM are in a heavyweight fight investing over $20 billion in AI in 2016.

In ancient times people were afraid of the Lights. Some
people call them the Northern Lights. There are times when the night sky glows with bands of color.

The bands may begin as cloud shapes and then spread into a great arc across the entire sky.

The money spent on procurement, loading, transport, unloading, storage, financing, spoilage and pilferage of grain far in excess of what is needed for food security is money that could be spent on healthcare, education, reformed policing, the storage, processing and transport of crops other than grain.The farmers’ agitation represents the struggle of the rural elite to retain their stranglehold over a large chunk of State resources wholly irrelevant to food security, at the expense of the working poor. This is politics of blackmail, cloaked in the pantomime garb of the brave son of the soil taking on giant corporates.The government has offered that the minimum support price (MSP) system would continue, besides to withdraw the wholly undemocratic denial of right to legal remedy in the courts for disputes under the laws. Nor is excess procurement the only source of rich farmer coddling: the money spent on free power, free irrigation and subsidised farm inputs must be reckoned, too.The bogey of wily corporate jumbos trampling innocent farmers underfoot is raised to keep the conflict with the poor out of sight.
